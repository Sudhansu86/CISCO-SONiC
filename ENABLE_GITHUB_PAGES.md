## 🚀 Quick Steps to Enable GitHub Pages

### **Step 1: Go to Repository Settings**

Click this link to go directly to GitHub Pages settings:

Or manually:
1. Go to: https://github.com/Sudhansu86/CISCO-SONiC
2. Click the **"Settings"** tab (top right)
3. Scroll down and click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar

### **Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages**

You'll see a section called **"Build and deployment"**

1. Click the dropdown that says "None" or "Deploy from a branch"
2. Select: **"Deploy from a branch"**

Under **"Branch"**:
1. First dropdown: Select **"master"** (your code is on master branch)
2. Second dropdown: Select **"/docs"** (your web demo is in the docs folder)
3. Click the **"Save"** button

---

### **Step 3: Wait for Deployment**

After clicking Save:
- GitHub will show a message: "Your site is ready to be published"
- Wait 2-3 minutes for the build process
- Refresh the page to see the status
- When ready, you'll see: "Your site is live at https://sudhansu86.github.io/CISCO-SONiC/"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "master" branch not showing in dropdown**
- Your code was pushed to "master" branch (not "main")
- Make sure you select "master" from the dropdown

### **Issue: 404 error when visiting web demo**
- Wait a few more minutes (can take up to 5 minutes)
- Check that you selected "/docs" folder (not "/ (root)")
- Verify the branch is "master"

### **Issue: Web demo shows but doesn't work**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Make sure you're using a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

### **Issue: Changes not showing**
- GitHub Pages caches content
- Wait 5-10 minutes after pushing changes
- Try incognito/private browsing mode
